# spec.md Phase 2/3 exit criterion: an unmodified CUDA source file compiles with cumetalc into a
# runnable executable and produces correct output on the Apple GPU.
#
# This gate exists because the project shipped for a long time with a cumetalc that could only
# emit a .metallib, which meant users had to hand-split every program into a .cu plus a host .cpp
# and pass a metallib path at runtime. Do not relax it into a skip: if the driver cannot build a
# working binary from samples/vectorAdd/vectorAdd.cu, the documented primary path is broken.
