# PhysX patch workflow

These patches target NVIDIA Omniverse PhysX tag `107.3-physx-5.6.1`,
commit `5ca9f472105a90d70d957c243cb0ef36fe251a9f`.

Apply the patch set to a sibling checkout:

```bash
scripts/physx-patches/apply_physx_patches.sh ../PhysX
```

The application script is idempotent and rejects any other PhysX revision.
The patch reuses PhysX's Unix/Linux CMake source lists while allowing the
compiler to select the existing `PX_OSX`, `PX_APPLE_FAMILY`, and `PX_A64`
source paths. It does not add or enable GPU projects.

The second patch adds an opt-in `PhysXCumetalGpuKernels` target. It invokes
`cumetalc --cuda-device` for the explicit SnippetHelloGRB sphere-plane kernel
manifest without enabling CMake's CUDA language or modifying NVIDIA kernels.

The third patch enables PhysX's existing GPU-facing public declarations for
the opt-in `PX_CUMETAL` Apple ARM64 build and supplies the CuMetal-only CUDA
frontend definitions. Other Apple and upstream CUDA configurations are
unchanged.

The fourth patch expands the bootstrap to the 83 entry points statically
needed by reduced `SnippetHelloGRB` with PGS and sphere/plane geometry. It
deliberately excludes articulations, joints, aggregates, freezing, threshold
reporting, convex/mesh/SDF collision, deformables, particles, and Direct GPU
API-only entry points.

The fifth patch builds and links the GPU host runtime against
`libcumetal.dylib`, loads the source-recompiled per-kernel metallibs through
`CudaKernelWrangler`, minimizes `SnippetHelloGRB`, and introduced the original
body-per-thread pre-integration compatibility path.

The sixth patch adds CPU/GPU mode selection, step count, and per-step
transform dumps to the reduced snippet for the conformance gate.

The seventh patch brings up the selected sphere/plane contact path. It adds
CuMetal-safe scalar compaction and static-batch preparation, replaces CUDA-UVA
pointer subtraction with device-buffer offsets, and uses reduced normal-only
contact preparation/solve paths. Friction, joints, articulations, and general
multi-body scenes remain outside this target.

The eighth patch removes the serialized `updateBodiesLaunch` and body-per-thread
pre-integration fallbacks. CuMetal's masked vote, shuffle, SIMD-group barrier,
and entry-specific static shared-memory paths now execute PhysX's upstream
warp-cooperative implementations through repeated 30-step conformance runs.

The ninth patch enables the selected sphere/plane kinetic-friction path. It
builds one friction anchor without expanding the unsupported generic patch
cache, restores the real contact solver's friction loop, and adds friction and
friction-disabled snippet modes with linear/angular velocity dumps. The
60-step gate matches CPU through the initial sliding phase and verifies a
material GPU friction response against the disabled control. Persistent static
friction and long-horizon rolling conformance remain out of scope.

The tenth patch closes the selected sphere/plane rolling-friction gap. It
clears the one-body accumulated solver deltas at each simulation step, stages
the bounded previous friction patch without the unsupported generic device
pointer traversal, and verifies CPU/GPU rolling agreement at step 60. Generic
friction correlation and multi-body batching remain out of scope.

The eleventh patch adds selected multibody rigid/static coverage. It schedules
each contact pre-prep and prepare batch in a dedicated 32-lane Metal SIMD
group, indexes the reduced static solver and delta reset across island bodies,
and adds `--bodies 1..16` to the snippet. The conformance claim covers two
separated dynamic spheres against one plane; dynamic/dynamic constraints and
packed general batching remain out of scope.

The twelfth patch adds selected dynamic/dynamic contact batching. It replaces
shared device-pointer staging in the zero and motion-writeback kernels with
direct Metal-safe indexing, runs the prepared rigid-contact block solver, and
serially aggregates and propagates each body's slab contributions. The snippet
adds a two-sphere `--stacked` layout. CPU and GPU agree for 30 frictional and
frictionless steps; larger stacks, joints, articulations, and packed general
batching remain out of scope.

The thirteenth patch adds the convex/plane narrowphase entry and a selectable
unit box to the reduced snippet. CuMetal's compiler now lays out only the
selected entry's aligned static shared objects, so the convex kernel's contact
scratch no longer starts beyond its allocated Metal threadgroup buffer. The
30-step frictionless box/plane gate preserves four distinct corner contacts
and matches CPU transforms. General convex meshes and other convex pair types
remain outside this claim.

The fourteenth patch adds PhysX's box/box narrowphase entry. CuMetal's CUDA
frontend forces all viable device calls to inline when the project requests an
inline threshold, eliminating the remaining `getIncidentPolygon4` PTX call.
The selected two-unit-box stack stays supported and matches CPU body states
over 30 frictionless steps. General oriented-box stress cases and larger box
stacks remain unverified.

The fifteenth patch adds the upstream two-stage convex/convex GJK/EPA entries
to the reproducible kernel manifest. Stage 2 compiles from canonical non-inline
NVVM through the typed CuMetal IR backend. Stage 1 remains on the explicit
legacy PTX backend because typed generic-pointer legalization rejects conflicting
address-space flow.

The sixteenth patch adds a cooked six-vertex convex prism to the reduced
snippet and selects typed CuMetal IR only for convex/convex stage 2. The
30-step two-prism frictionless stack exercises both GJK/EPA stages, contact
finalization, dynamic and static preparation/solve, writeback, and integration.
CPU/GPU states stay within a documented 1% component-wise envelope; this is a
selected topology and pair, not a general convex-mesh compatibility claim.

The seventeenth patch adds six sphere/triangle-mesh midphase, narrowphase,
sorting, correlation, and finish entries. Its compact CuMetal path verifies one
frictionless unit sphere moving over the interior of one face in a two-triangle
static ground mesh for 30 steps, with byte-identical CPU/GPU states. The path
carries its one contact separation in the correlation index because the generic
temporary-contact record is not yet coherent across these dispatches. Seam
transitions, multiple bodies, friction, boxes/convexes against meshes, capsules,
heightfields, and SDFs remain outside this claim and are rejected by the snippet.

The eighteenth patch extends that selected flat mesh through a coplanar internal
triangle seam. PhysX stores `NONCONVEX_FLAG` in adjacency indices; the compact
path now masks that flag, recognizes when the projected sphere center lies on
the adjacent coplanar face, and carries plane separation during the cached-face
handoff. The 30-step trajectory starts at `x=-0.5`, crosses the diagonal, and
remains byte-identical to CPU. Non-coplanar seams and general mesh traversal are
still unverified.

The nineteenth patch removes the frictionless-only guard for the selected
one-sphere mesh path. The existing one-anchor friction preparation and static
solver reach no-slip rolling after crossing the seam: CPU/GPU state stays within
the established `3e-3` 60-step envelope, while a friction-disabled GPU control
retains `vx=5` and zero spin. Other shapes, multiple bodies, and generic mesh
friction correlation remain unsupported.

The twentieth patch makes the host runtime patch series self-contained by
adding the `CuMetalKernelInitStubs.cpp` file already referenced by patch 0005.
These empty link anchors replace the init symbols normally emitted by nvcc;
CuMetal loads the source-recompiled kernels by name at runtime.

The twenty-first patch is what a 2 800-body benchmark scene (a voxel animator's
collapsing body: convex-hull chunks in a column, locked spheres carpeting the
ground — the scene, the snippet options that go with it and the animator's
physics server live in the game's repository, `tools/gpu-physics/patches/`,
applied after this series) found and fixed in the GPU pipeline on an M4 Max
(each with its evidence in the code comments):

- `contactConstraintBlockPrep.cuh`: PhysX's own per-pair friction correlation
  (`getFrictionPatches`) is back. Patches 0007/0010 had replaced it with a
  reuse of whatever anchors the batch slot held from an earlier frame — no
  pair identity — so a ball dropped next to where another had bounced got a
  sideways kick towards that spot, and a new slot's garbage anchors broke the
  constraint.
- `PxgContext.cpp`: the CPU's static-batch bound follows the one-batch-per-
  contact layout that patch 0011's serial `rigidSumInternalContactAndJointBatches2`
  builds; it assumed PhysX's 32-body packing, so the second body touching a
  static landed out of bounds and was never solved.
- `constraintBlockPrePrep.cu`: lane 0 reserves block-contact slots from the
  warp-wide maximum contact count again (the series had made it lane 0's own
  count); convex pairs with more contacts than lane 0's overran their batch.
- `PxgCudaUtils.h`: the DMA-back handshake no longer spins on the pinned flag
  a one-thread kernel writes — Metal does not make earlier blits visible when
  a mid-command-buffer store is observed, and ~40 % of runs read stale or zero
  poses — every caller falls back to its stream synchronization.
- `cudaGJKEPA.cu`: after GJK/EPA, a contact is rejected when the support
  functions show the hulls separated by more than the contact distance along
  the returned direction, the centre line or a hull axis (exact; never rejects
  a genuine contact). Under both CuMetal backends `convexConvexNphase_stage2Kernel`
  still misjudges some distant new pairs (the typed backend: four contacts
  metres "deep" for hulls metres apart; the legacy backend: no contacts at
  all — `PX_CUMETAL_STAGE2_LEGACY=ON` builds it that way for comparison), so
  this guard is a mitigation, not the fix.

The `HF_DEBUG_FRICTION=1` prints in the solver and narrowphase cores
(friction-count clears, new-pair manifolds, removal compaction against the CPU
mirror, the pointers the narrowphase hands back) are part of it.

What is still open with this series: the stage-2 kernel's compiler-level
misjudgements above, and the runtime not being safe under PhysX's several
worker threads driving their streams at once — the 2 800-body pile explodes
in most runs with 4 workers and is stable in every run with 1
(`--threads 1`).

Build and verify the static CPU SDK and non-rendering HelloWorld snippet:

```bash
scripts/physx-patches/build_physx_cpu_macos.sh
```

By default, artifacts are written outside the PhysX checkout under
`build/physx-cpu-macos-arm64`. Set `PHYSX_REPO` or
`CUMETAL_PHYSX_BUILD_DIR` to override either location.

Build the Phase 2 kernel subset with a real Apple metallib:

```bash
scripts/physx-patches/build_physx_cumetal_kernels_macos.sh
```

This defaults to `xcrun` emission. Set
`CUMETAL_PHYSX_EMIT_MODE=experimental` to validate the compiler pipeline on a
machine that has Xcode but has not downloaded the optional Metal Toolchain
component; experimental containers are inspectable test artifacts and are not
GPU-executable.

The build script requires macOS on arm64, CMake, Ninja, `xcrun`, and Xcode's
optional Metal Toolchain component (which it discovers automatically). It
compiles all 93 manifest entries, validates and inspects every output, and
prints a machine-readable `PASS` line.

Build and run the reduced GPU rigid-body snippet end to end:

```bash
scripts/physx-patches/build_physx_cumetal_grb_macos.sh
```

This enables native Metal GPU virtual addresses for CUDA device allocations,
which is required for the nested device pointers in PhysX descriptor structs.
The script verifies successful Apple GPU kernel dispatch and non-zero gravity
integration before printing `PASS`.

Run CPU/GPU transform conformance:

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb.sh
```

The sphere starts in resting contact with the plane, so the default 30-step
window exercises narrowphase, constraint preparation, the static contact
solver, writeback, and integration. It uses `1e-3` relative plus `1e-5`
absolute tolerance.

Run the selected sliding-to-rolling friction gate:

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb_friction.sh
```

Run the selected two-body rigid/static batching gate:

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb_multibody.sh
```

Run the selected stacked dynamic/dynamic contact gate (frictional and
frictionless spheres plus frictionless boxes and convex prisms):

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb_stacked.sh
```

Run the selected four-point box/plane contact gate:

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb_box.sh
```

Run the selected sphere/static-triangle-mesh gate and unsupported-shape
negative control:

```bash
tests/conformance/run_physx_grb_trimesh.sh
```
