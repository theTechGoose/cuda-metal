## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The cuDNN v8 RNN API**, which is the generation frameworks call:
  `cudnnSetRNNDescriptor_v8`/`_v8` getter, `cudnnRNNForward`, the RNN data descriptor
  (`cudnnCreate`/`Set`/`Get`/`DestroyRNNDataDescriptor`), `cudnnGetRNNWeightSpaceSize`,
  `cudnnGetRNNTempSpaceSizes`, `cudnnGetRNNWeightParams` and `cudnnBuildRNNDynamic`, plus the
  v7 weight-layout queries `cudnnGetRNNLinLayerMatrixParams`/`BiasParams` that PyTorch's
  pre-v8 branch uses. Previously none of these were declared, so a `torch.nn.LSTM` failed on a
  missing entry point regardless of what the bounded v6/v7 path supported. The weight layout
  round-trips: the engine's gate order is i,f,g,o, which is both cuDNN's `linLayerID` order and
  PyTorch's chunk order, so the offsets `cudnnGetRNNWeightParams` reports are the offsets the
  forward reads and a framework's weight copy lands correctly. All three data layouts are
  accepted; batch-major is staged into sequence-major rather than teaching the engine two
  layouts. Still the bounded CPU-backed engine, and still FP32/standard-algorithm/zero-dropout;
  recurrent projection (`proj_size != 0`) returns `CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED` rather than
  being ignored, because a silently unprojected LSTM would return confidently wrong output.
  Ragged batches are refused for the same reason.
  `tests/functional/cudnn_rnn_v8_test.cpp` checks the property a decoder depends on: single
  timestep calls carrying `(h, c)` forward produce exactly what one full-sequence call produces.

### Added

- **Releases ship the PhysX patch series**, under `share/cumetal/physx-patches/`, so building
  PhysX's GPU runtime against a release no longer needs the source archive fetched alongside it
  purely for these files. The patches are diffs against NVIDIA PhysX (tag `107.3-physx-5.6.1`,
  commit `5ca9f47`), which is BSD 3-Clause, so they carry its source as diff context; `NOTICE.md`
  and the verbatim upstream `PHYSX-LICENSE.md` ship with them, which is the attribution that
  license asks of a source redistribution. The release fails if either is missing from the stage
  or if the staged license text is not the BSD-3 notice.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **Sub-warp shuffles no longer read outside their segment on the typed backend.** A CUDA
  shuffle narrower than the warp confines each lane to its own segment of that width. PTX
  encodes the bound as `maxLane = (lane & segmask) | (cval & ~segmask)`; the typed
  (`cumetal-ir`) MSL backend emitted `maxLane = (lane & segmask) | cval`, dropping the segment
  mask. The bound then sat above the lane's own segment, the validity predicate passed where it
  should have clamped, and the lane read a **neighbouring segment's value** -- affecting
  `__shfl_sync`, `__shfl_down_sync` and `__shfl_xor_sync` at every width below 32
  (`__shfl_up_sync` clamps on `minLane` and was correct). At width 32 `segmask` is 0 and the two
  forms agree, which is why it never showed: the suite's only shuffle test used a full-warp
  `__shfl_sync`. The legacy backend computes the segment arithmetically and was always right.
  Found from a PhysX consumer's report that `convexConvexNphase_stage2Kernel` reported two
  convex hulls 0.69 m apart as metres deep, on the typed backend only, with a contact normal
  that was not even a separating axis -- the signature of a lane reading another lane's vertex.
  `tests/cuda_projects/subwarp_shuffle_width` covers all four modes at widths 2/4/8/16/32 on
  both backends, computing its expectations from the CUDA definition rather than from what the
  backend happens to produce.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **A release can compile FP64 kernels on a machine that has never seen this checkout.**
  `cumetalc` and the runtime addressed CuMetal's own Metal support sources as
  `CUMETAL_SOURCE_DIR/compiler/metal/support/...` -- a compile-time path to the machine that
  BUILT the binary. A release therefore handed `xcrun` a file living inside a source checkout
  that exists nowhere else, and the FP64 support link failed for every user who had not built
  CuMetal themselves in that exact directory. It was invisible here because on a build machine
  the path is real. Reported from 0.6.1 by a consumer building PhysX's GPU runtime, whose
  compiler log showed the release reaching into `/Users/.../cuda-metal/compiler/metal/support/`.
  The sources are resolved at runtime now, from the binary's own location (`dladdr`, so it works
  for both `cumetalc` and `libcumetal.dylib`), with the source tree kept only as the last resort
  that makes an uninstalled build work. `CUMETAL_METAL_SUPPORT_DIR` overrides it.
- **Releases ship those support sources.** They were not in the tarball at all. They are staged
  as a miniature source tree under `libexec/cumetal/metal-support/`, because they include
  VF64-metal's shaders by a path relative to their own directory -- shipping the two files alone
  produced a *different* failure (`'../../../third_party/VF64-metal/...' file not found`), which
  is what verifying the fix against a real install prefix caught.

### Added

- **Release gates against shipping a tree that only works here.** `mac_release_build.sh` fails
  the release if the support sources (or the VF64 shaders they include) are missing from the
  stage, or if the staged `cumetalc` cannot compile an FP64-touching kernel while reaching only
  the staged tree for its support source. A presence check alone would not have caught the
  relative include, so the last gate compiles a real kernel. It does not yet assert that shipped
  binaries cannot reach the build checkout at all: the build tree finds its own headers through
  `CUMETAL_SOURCE_DIR` and the release build is also the test build, so compiling that fallback
  out fails the suite. Making the build tree self-describing is the follow-up.
- **`scripts/mac_ctest.sh`** builds a target and runs a ctest selection on the Mac, so an
  investigation from a container can get an answer without a full release build.
  `CUMETAL_CTEST_REPEAT=N` re-runs the selection, which race hunting needs: one clean pass of a
  concurrency test proves nothing. `CUMETAL_CTEST_ARGS` passes extra ctest flags.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- **A deferred pointer restore no longer runs on another thread's copy, which corrupted data
  when threads shared a stream.** 0.6.1 deferred the embedded-pointer restore of a
  device-to-host blit to the next synchronization covering it, and let whichever thread
  synchronized run every restore pending on that stream. The restore is a read-modify-write
  of the destination, so a thread running another thread's entry could stage those bytes,
  have the owner's *next* blit land underneath it, and write the pre-blit content back --
  destroying data the copy had correctly delivered. It needed a shared stream to happen, and
  PhysX drives its GPU pipeline from several workers on one stream, which is the case
  0.6.1 shipped broken: four threads on the legacy stream, each with private buffers, and
  a destination still holding the reader's own fill pattern after a successful
  `cudaStreamSynchronize` (9 of 10 runs; 0 of 10 on 0.6.0, and 0 of 10 with the restore
  book disabled). A restore now runs only on the thread that issued its copy, and every
  drain is bounded by the stream's sequence as it stood *before* the wait began rather than
  by "everything pending". A copy issued on one thread and awaited only on another keeps its
  device pointers, as it did before 0.6.1 -- the rarer case, and not corruption.
  `tests/functional/multi_worker_stream_stress_test.cpp` is the reproduction: four workers
  across four phases -- own stream, cross-stream event, allocation churn, and the shared
  legacy stream -- each checking its own results byte for byte over 64 rounds.

### Added

- **`scripts/mac_ctest.sh`** builds a target and runs a ctest selection on the Mac, so an
  investigation from a container can get an answer without a full release build.
  `CUMETAL_CTEST_REPEAT=N` re-runs the selection, which race hunting needs: one clean pass
  of a concurrency test proves nothing.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Contact reporting on the GPU no longer crashes the host: a device-to-host blit into
  pinned memory now gets the embedded-pointer restore.** A D2H copy whose destination is
  pinned memory is a Metal blit -- a raw byte copy in the stream's command buffer -- so
  `restore_embedded_host_pointers()`, which the host-function copy path has always applied,
  never ran on it. The device addresses embedded in the copied bytes reached the CPU intact.
  Under `CUMETAL_USE_METAL_DEVICE_ADDRESSES=1`, PhysX's GPU narrowphase blits its
  contact-manager output back to pinned host memory, and any application reading contact
  points from it -- `PxContactPair::extractContacts()` inside a
  `PxSimulationEventCallback::onContact` -- dereferenced a GPU virtual address and died with
  `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` on the first step with a touch (reported against 0.6.0 at
  `0x1000a09e1b0`). A scene with no contact listener never reads those bytes, which is why
  0.6.0's own async-copy work did not surface it. The blit cannot restore in place while the
  GPU may still be writing, so each one is recorded and its restore runs at the next
  stream, event or device synchronization that covers it -- the point after which the CPU
  may legitimately read the destination at all.
- **`cuMemsetD16Async`/`cuMemsetD32Async` are stream-ordered.** They wrote through the host
  pointer at call time, ignoring the stream, so with the CPU running ahead of the GPU queue
  a clear landed *before* the still-pending kernels it was meant to follow. PhysX clears its
  solver, narrowphase and activation buffers with `memsetD32Async` between dependent
  launches every step, and lost contacts and inherited stale friction from it -- invisible
  under `CUMETAL_SYNC_EACH_LAUNCH=1`, which serialises everything and hides the ordering.
  Both are enqueued on the stream timeline now, and the synchronous `cuMemsetD16`/
  `cuMemsetD32` wait for the device first, as `cudaMemset` does.
- **A destroyed stream no longer leaves deferred restores behind.** The pending-restore book
  is keyed by the backend stream's address, which the allocator hands out again;
  `cudaStreamDestroy` now applies what is due (it synchronizes) and forgets the rest, so a
  later stream landing on that address cannot inherit them and write through host
  destinations that may already be freed.
- **Releases ship all of `runtime/api`.** `include/` was an install list maintained by hand
  and had drifted to 79 of 105 headers, with none of the extensionless `cuda/std/*` ones.
  `vector_types.h` and `vector_functions.h` were among the missing, and PhysX's host code
  includes them (`gpucommon/include/cutil_math.h`), so the 0.6.0 tarball could not build
  PhysX's GPU runtime against its own `include/`. The headers install as a tree now, and
  `scripts/mac_release_build.sh` fails the release if a header in the source is not in the
  staged `include/`.

### Added

- **`scripts/physx-patches/0021-gpu-pipeline-fixes.patch`** -- five fixes to the series' GPU
  pipeline that a 2 800-body scene (convex-hull chunks collapsing onto a carpet of locked
  spheres) found, each carrying its evidence in the code comments: PhysX's own per-pair
  friction correlation restored (0007/0010 reused another pair's anchors); the CPU's
  static-batch bound follows the one-batch-per-contact layout 0011's serial stage 2 builds;
  block-contact slots come from the warp maximum again; the DMA-back handshake synchronizes
  instead of spinning on a pinned flag Metal does not order; and a support-function guard
  rejects impossible convex contacts after GJK/EPA (a mitigation -- `convexConvexNphase_
  stage2Kernel` still misjudges some distant new pairs under both backends).
  `HF_DEBUG_FRICTION=1` prints in the solver and narrowphase cores. `apply_physx_patches.sh`
  learns a marker for the 0010 hunk this rewrites, so the series no longer tries to re-apply
  0010 on a tree that already has 0021.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **The AIR/MSL dialect is now detected from the installed Metal toolchain.** It used to be
  hardcoded in four places across three files (AIR 2.8, MSL 4.0, `air64_v28`, `macosx26.0.0`),
  which is Xcode 26 only. On Xcode 16.4 that failed twice, in two different places, for two
  different reasons: `air-lld` refused to link (`air version set to 2.8.0 ... but expecting
  2.7`) and, when that was worked around, the runtime refused to load the metallib
  (`language version 4.0 which is not supported on this OS`). The second failure happened
  after a clean compile and link, so kernels silently never ran and their output buffers
  stayed zeroed -- which reads downstream as wrong numerical results rather than a version
  problem. `cumetal::common::detected_air_dialect()` now compiles a trivial kernel with the
  installed compiler and reads back the dialect it emits. Every version constant lives in
  `compiler/common/include/cumetal/common/air_toolchain.h`; `CUMETAL_AIR_DIALECT=<air>/<msl>`
  overrides it, and a failed probe falls back conservatively with a diagnostic instead of
  guessing silently.
- **Per-kernel FP64 policy.** `CUMETAL_FP64_MODE=wide48;solve=ieee64` sets a global mode plus
  per-kernel overrides, matched against the mangled symbol by exact name then by substring.
  One global mode forced a whole-program tradeoff; measured, `ieee64` is bit-exact at ~1.43x
  `fast48`, so buying exactness for the few kernels that need it costs almost nothing overall.
- **FP64 accuracy gates (`tests/fp64_ulp`).** Each policy is compared against hardware
  binary64 and its worst-case drift reported in ULPs. `ieee64` is gated at a budget of **0**:
  it claims correctly rounded binary64, and that claim is either true or it is not.
- **`deploy.sh`** builds, gates, packages and releases from `main`. It runs directly on macOS
  and delegates through a host bridge when run from a container, with the release build itself
  in `scripts/mac_release_build.sh`, which knows nothing about how it was invoked.

### Changed

- **The default FP64 policy is `wide48`, was `fast48`.** Both carry a ~48-bit significand, but
  `fast48` keeps binary32's exponent range, so a value that is finite in CUDA silently becomes
  `inf` past ~1e38. Measured cost of the change is 17% on a division-heavy compute-bound
  kernel; silent overflow is not worth 17%. `CUMETAL_FP64_MODE=fast48` opts back in.
- **No input kind defaults to unrunnable output any more.** `cumetalc` defaulted to `native`
  for every input and patched `.cu` back to a working mode later, so `cumetalc foo.ptx`
  silently produced a binary that died at pipeline creation. `native` and `warn` remain
  available and now explain, at compile time, why they will fail on Apple Silicon.
- **The FP64 emulation warnings name the modes that work.** They previously pointed at
  `CUMETAL_FP64_MODE=native`, which cannot execute on Apple Silicon, and never mentioned
  `wide48` or `ieee64`.

### Fixed

- **`fma.rn.f32` was not fused.** It lowered to a separate `fmul` and `fadd` with no
  contraction flags, so it rounded twice where PTX mandates one rounding -- slower, less
  accurate, and bit-divergent from CUDA on the most common path in any GEMM or reduction.
  Both now lower to `@llvm.fma.f32` / `@llvm.fma.f16`. `mad` keeps the unfused form, which
  PTX permits for it.
- **WMMA emitted AIR 2.8's `simdgroup_matrix` signature unconditionally.** The intrinsic has
  the same name in both dialects but took different argument types before 2.8, so on an older
  toolchain it failed as `invalid AIR function` -- which reads like a missing feature but is
  an overload mismatch. The load/store signature now follows the detected dialect.
- **Three shell harnesses died on macOS's bash 3.2.** Expanding `"${ARR[@]}"` on an empty
  array under `set -u` is fatal there, and `#!/usr/bin/env bash` resolves to `/bin/bash`.
  `scripts/ci_report.sh` hit it whenever no extra ctest arguments were passed -- that is, on
  every release invocation -- and two functional harnesses hit it on their default paths,
  taking 14 tests down with them.
- **Two tests pinned one Xcode release's dialect as a universal invariant.**
  `air_abi_xcode_matrix_regression` asserted `air.version=2.8` against the toolchain's own
  output, so it failed on every toolchain except the author's; it now derives the expected
  dialect from the toolchain under test, which is the drift it exists to catch.
- **Widen/narrow round trips are eliminated.** `cvt.rn.f32.f64(cvt.f64.f32(x))` is the
  identity -- widening is exact and narrowing back round-to-nearest returns the input
  bit-for-bit -- but under software FP64 it cost two emulated library calls. Recognised
  within a basic block and invalidated at every branch, label, call and predicated
  instruction.

- **Typed PTX vector stores wrote only their first lane.** `st.global.v2.b32 [addr], {%r1, %r2}`
  (Clang's spelling for two adjacent struct fields at `-O2`) stored `%r1` and silently dropped
  `%r2`; vector loads bound only their first destination. Both now expand to one memory operation
  per lane at the right byte displacement. Found by the inline-PTX fixture's result struct, whose
  second field read back as zero on the PTX path.
- **Bare register names were not registers on the PTX paths.** PTX allows `.reg .pred p;` and then
  `p` without a `%`; the parser dropped the directive and every path treated `p` as an unknown
  operand, which crashed the MSL lowering on the `setp` that defined it. The parser now renames such
  registers to `%cm_r_<name>` and records their declared types, and the lowering reports an
  operation with no result instead of dereferencing one.
- **Doubles could not cross a device-call boundary.** The MSL lowering treated the FP64 mode as a
  legality gate on every call, so a user function with a `double` parameter or result was refused
  as an unsupported software FP64 call. A double crosses a call as its 64-bit storage word and only
  builtin math needs a helper; user calls now take the ordinary path, `fabs`/`copysign` on doubles
  are sign-bit operations, and `tests/cuda_projects/fp64_device_calls` checks parameters, returns,
  pointers and a struct of doubles on the direct path.
- **Pointer fields inside aggregates carried one address space for every instance.** A struct such
  as Warp's `array_t` returned by value had its pointer field typed `thread`, so extracting it into
  a `device` pointer failed in Apple's compiler. Aggregate pointer fields are now stored as raw
  64-bit addresses and reinterpreted at each extraction to the space that use resolved to.
- **An `undef` scalar argument reached the MSL as the identifier `undef`.** Clang at `-O0` passes
  an uninitialised variable as `undef`; it is now imported as zero.
- **Inline PTX was rejected unless it matched one of five strings.** The NVVM importer compared
  the `asm` template against `mov %laneid`, `mov %activemask`, three `shfl.sync` forms and a float
  `atom.add`, and refused everything else, which took down every NVIDIA Warp module that touched
  `float16` (`cvt.rn.f16.f32`) or fast division (`div.approx.f32`). Inline PTX is now lowered by
  the PTX instruction importer itself: operands are bound to synthetic registers from the
  constraint string, including immediates, tied `+r` operands and multi-output blocks, and the
  template is parsed and lowered in place, so anything the typed PTX path supports works inside
  `asm`. Control flow inside a template and `${N:mod}` modifiers are refused with a diagnostic.
  `tests/cuda_projects/inline_ptx_idioms` checks half conversions, approximate division, wide and
  high multiplies, an immediate, a tied operand and a block-local predicate against the host on
  both the direct and PTX paths.
- **Generated Metal code ran under fast-math, so `NaN == NaN` was true and `x != x` false.** Apple's
  `metal` compiler defaults to `-ffast-math -ffinite-math-only`, and CuMetal passed no math flags,
  so every NaN guard in a CUDA kernel was folded away. CUDA's contract is IEEE comparisons with NaN
  and infinity preserved and FMA contraction allowed; generated MSL is now compiled that way
  (`-fno-fast-math -ffp-contract=fast`), the runtime JIT's `CUMETAL_MSL_MATH_MODE` defaults to
  `safe`, and `--use_fast_math` (or `CUMETAL_MSL_MATH_MODE=fast`) is the explicit opt-in. The NVVM
  importer also keeps LLVM's ordered/unordered floating predicates apart (`FCMP_ONE` is no longer
  spelled `!=`), and `isnan`/`isinf`/`isfinite`/`signbit` are `__device__` overloads lowered to
  Metal's bit-pattern builtins on all three lowering paths, including the double forms on the
  binary64 storage word. `tests/cuda_projects/nan_semantics` checks all of it against the host.
- **NVRTC's `--device-as-default-execution-space` was dropped.** NVRTC treats every unannotated
  function as device code; CuMetal's shim logged the option and compiled with Clang's host
  default, so a `constexpr` helper, a constructor or a lambda without `__device__` produced
  `reference to __host__ function` and Warp's tile headers could not build. `cumetalc` now honours
  the option (`#pragma clang force_cuda_host_device begin`, force-included after the SDK headers
  that `cuda_runtime.h` pre-includes so their declarations stay host-only), and the shim maps it,
  `--std=`, `--fmad=` and `--use_fast_math` instead of ignoring them. `cumetalc` also accepts
  `-std=`, `-U`, `-O<n>`, `--fmad=`, `--use_fast_math` and `--clang-arg`.
- **Generic-pointer legalization refused well-formed CUDA.** Three shapes produced `cannot legalize
  CUDA generic pointers: unresolved generic pointer address space`, the largest compile-failure class
  in NVIDIA Warp's test suite (about 70 modules): a device helper that nothing calls (Clang emits every
  external-linkage function, and Warp generates an `add(const S&, const S&)` per struct "for adjoints"),
  a host-populated pointer field such as `array_t::data` read through a private by-value copy of the
  descriptor, and a helper returning one of its reference arguments (`T& operator+=`) called with both
  a local and a device object. The legalizer now prunes functions no kernel reaches, defaults a pointer
  component with no in-module producer to device memory (the only thing such a pointer can be on Metal
  besides null or dead), and types each call result from the operand the caller passed while every
  address-space clone of the helper returns its own space. A return that merges non-argument sources of
  different spaces is still refused, now with a precise message. `CUMETAL_DEBUG_ADDRESS_SPACES=1`
  reports every defaulted value.
- **Function-local constant tables were referenced but never declared.** The NVVM importer only
  embedded initialised read-only globals that Clang placed in address space 4 (`static const` in
  device code). Function-local `const T tbl[] = {...}`, brace-initialised aggregate temporaries and
  string literals live in address space 0 under Clang's `__const.<fn>.<var>`, `constinit` and `.str`
  names, so the MSL used them without a declaration and Apple's compiler failed on a temporary file
  with `use of undeclared identifier`. Every referenced initialised read-only global is now embedded as
  a `constant` byte array regardless of its address space or name, with its alignment, and an
  undefined `extern __device__` symbol is reported by the importer naming the CUDA symbol.
- **Apple's optimizer dropped reads of word-copied private aggregates.** Generated MSL reads and writes
  memory through reinterpreted pointers by design, because it translates LLVM's untyped loads, stores
  and byte-wise copies; under type-based aliasing a brace-initialised struct array copied word-wise
  into a private array came back as garbage at the default optimisation level. Every reinterpreting
  cast now goes through a `may_alias` spelling of its type, which holds under both the offline
  compiler and `newLibraryWithSource`, and the offline compiles also pass `-fno-strict-aliasing`.
- **`mul.wide` produced a 32-bit product.** The typed PTX importer typed `mul.wide.s32 %rd, %r, 4`,
  the byte offset of every indexed access, at the operand width, so the offset was a 32-bit multiply
  added to a pointer. Besides truncating real offsets, that shape trips an Apple compiler miscompile
  of 32-bit pointer displacements derived from a magic-number division: `table[i % 6]` read zero for
  every `i >= 6` while `i % 5` worked. The product is now 64-bit with sign- or zero-extended operands,
  and a signed `mul.hi` reinterprets its operands as signed before widening instead of zero-extending
  them.
- **Async copies staged from pageable memory could dangle.** Follow-up to the pageable-memory fix: the
  2D and 3D staging buffers were not captured by the deferred copy and were freed before it ran.
- **Asynchronous copies into pageable host memory corrupted the heap.** `cudaMemcpyAsync`,
  `cudaMemcpy{2D,3D}Async`, `cudaMemcpyFromSymbolAsync`, `cudaMemset{,2D,3D}Async` and the driver's
  `cuMemcpy2DAsync` deferred every copy to the stream's host-op queue, so a device-to-host copy into
  a stack variable or a temporary `std::vector` landed after the caller had freed the memory.
  `cudaMemcpyToSymbolAsync` likewise read its pageable source later. CUDA's contract is that a copy
  whose host end is pageable is synchronous with respect to the host -- host-to-device returns once
  the source is staged, device-to-host and host-to-host return once the destination is written -- and
  only pinned memory is copied truly asynchronously. The runtime now follows that contract: pageable
  sources are staged at the call, pageable destinations are written before the call returns (still in
  stream order), and pinned and device ends keep the asynchronous path. NVIDIA Warp's test suite
  had been taking the interpreter down with a malloc heap-corruption trap in 21 of 87 modules;
  Guard Malloc pinned the write to the deferred `cudaMemcpyAsync` lambda on a dispatch worker
  thread. `functional_runtime_pageable_memcpy` parks a slow host function on the stream first, so
  a copy that was merely queued cannot pass, and `functional_runtime_memcpy2d` now asserts the
  contract instead of the old deferred behaviour.
- **A by-value aggregate kernel parameter could not be launched.** Clang lowers one to
  `ptr byval(%T)`, and the NVVM importer classified it as a pointer: the ABI sidecar said
  `arg buffer 8`, and `cuLaunchKernel` tried to resolve the first eight bytes of the caller's own
  struct as a device address. Depending on those bytes the launch either returned
  `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE` or, through the NULL-terminator fallback, bound garbage and ran a
  kernel that did nothing. The importer now takes the `byval` type's alloc size, so the parameter
  binds as bytes. This blocked every NVIDIA Warp kernel, all of which take a by-value
  `launch_bounds_t` first. `functional_byval_aggregate_launch` covers a launch end to end; the
  existing `byval_aggregate_memcpy` fixture only ever checked that such a kernel compiles.
- **The kernel ABI sidecar was lost between NVRTC and module load.** `cumetalc` writes it beside
  the metallib and the NVRTC shim deleted its workspace, so a caller that compiled in memory and
  loaded the bytes got no ABI metadata and `cuLaunchKernel` fell back to scanning `kernelParams`
  for a NULL terminator CUDA does not guarantee. `nvrtcGetCUBIN` now returns a CuMetal module
  image (`CUMTLMD1` magic, two lengths, the metallib, the sidecar) so the metadata survives any
  round trip that handles only bytes -- Warp's kernel cache, a later process --
  and `cuModuleLoadData` recognises the image and stages both parts.
- **The ABI sidecar described only the first kernel in a metallib.** NVIDIA Warp emits a forward
  and a backward kernel for every `@wp.kernel`, so every launch but the first was guessing its
  argument count. The sidecar is now `CUMETAL_ABI_V2`: one `kernel` block per entry, and the
  driver, runtime, and shared-memory readers seek the block they want by name.
- **NVRTC did not predefine `__CUDACC_RTC__`.** Real NVRTC does, and sources branch on it to skip
  includes that only a full toolkit has. CuMetal's device line force-includes `cuda_runtime.h`, so
  the declarations those branches expect are in fact present; the macro is now seeded ahead of the
  caller's options, and an explicit `--undefine-macro` still cancels it.

### Added

- `cudaTypedefs.h` now also spells each driver entry point unversioned
  (`PFN_cuGetProcAddress`), as NVIDIA's header does for the ABI the toolkit targets.
- `cudaErrorCallRequiresNewerDriver`, and the `CUDA_ARRAY3D_*` and `CU_TRSF_*` flag names, for
  hosts that resolve driver entry points themselves. The texture entry points still report
  `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`; these are spellings, not behaviour.
- `scripts/build_warp_cumetal.sh --build` runs Warp's `build_lib.py` to a linked
  `libwarp.dylib`: it picks a Python interpreter, passes `--cuda-path` (not `--cuda_path`) and
  `--no-use-libmathdx`, and the toolkit shim now carries a `libcumetal.dylib` name so `-lcuda`
  plus an rpath resolves the `@rpath`-relative install name.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **A float `selp` returned its operand's bit pattern as a number.** PTX keeps float temporaries in
  `.b32` registers, so `selp.f32` reads two integer-typed operands and produces a float one. The
  typed CuMetal IR importer assigned them straight across, and Metal read that as a numeric
  conversion: selecting between the bits of `1.0f` and `4.0f` produced `1082130432.0`. Every other
  arithmetic form already routes its operands through the bit container that turns a same-width
  float/integer mismatch into a bitcast; `selp` now does too. Found by a `cub::BlockReduce` max over
  `vec3` -- a comparison-selected float only escapes a kernel through a device call, so nothing in
  the corpus reached it. Third instance of the `.b32` register-typing class, after the 0.2.1 bug and
  the float atomics.
- **A scalar float device-call return was converted rather than reinterpreted.** The value reaching
  `st.param` carries its producing instruction's type, which for a float in a `.b32` register is not
  the declared return type; the aggregate return path reinterpreted each field but the scalar path
  did not. It stayed invisible because the float-to-integer and integer-to-float conversions
  cancelled for the values that happened to be tested, and became visible the moment the `selp` fix
  above stopped feeding it a value that round-tripped. `functional_cuda_projects_aggregate_device_calls`
  covers both, and fails on the aggregate case without the `selp` fix.
- **A float `atomicAdd` on `__shared__` memory silently did nothing on the PTX path.** CuMetal's
  CUDA overlay spells `atomicAdd(float*, float)` as inline `atom.global.add.f32` so the lowering
  selects Metal's native float atomic. The PTX-to-LLVM path already resolved the pointer's real
  state space from `cvta.shared`, but then emitted `atomicrmw fadd float addrspace(3)*`, and Metal
  has no threadgroup float atomic in any language version. `xcrun metallib` accepted the
  instruction and produced a kernel whose add never landed, so a `__shared__` accumulator kept its
  initial value with no diagnostic anywhere -- the registration/JIT path returned 0 for a
  256-thread block reduction. Threadgroup float adds now expand to the same compare-and-swap loop
  MSL spells by hand, over `air.atomic.local.cmpxchg.weak.i32`; other threadgroup float operations
  are refused explicitly rather than miscompiled. Device float atomics still use the native
  instruction. This shipped with the float-atomic lowering while runtime tests could not execute,
  so it landed unverified; `functional_cuda_projects_float_atomics` now covers it.
- **Float atomics on the typed CuMetal IR backend computed garbage.** PTX keeps float temporaries in
  `.b32` registers, so an atomic's payload arrives typed as an integer holding the value's bit
  pattern. The Metal atomic lowering converted it numerically instead of reinterpreting it:
  `atomicAdd(p, 1.0f)` emitted `float(1065353216)`, and the CAS loop clang expands a system-scope
  float add into passed a `float` into a `uint` parameter, so an accumulator ended at 2.8e-45 --
  the float whose bits are 2. Payload and result now bitcast between the storage word and the
  float. This is the same class of defect as the 0.2.1 `.b32` register typing bug, at the atomic
  sites that audit did not reach. `conformance_cuda_projects_typed_ptx_corpus` now passes 28/28.
- **Constant-size aggregate copies between two host-populated device-buffer descriptors failed to
  lower on the source-first path.** `struct A { float4* data; int n; }` passed by value and copied
  element-wise emits `llvm.memcpy` between pointers derived from two byval parameters; the offset
  pointers created while expanding that memcpy were not marked generic, so the address-space
  legalizer rejected them with `host-populated pointer field reaches a conflicting concrete address
  space`. Generic status now propagates to those synthetic pointers. This was the blocker for nearly
  every generated NVIDIA Warp kernel; see `docs/warp-feasibility.md`.
- **`atomicAdd(float*, float)` did not compile on the source-first path.** The CUDA overlay spells
  it as inline `atom.global.add.f32` so the PTX path selects Metal's native float atomic, and the
  `cumetal-ir` backend rejected its own asm; `__fAtomicAdd` (`atomicrmw fadd`) then failed in Metal
  atomic lowering, which accepted only integer payloads. Both spellings, and PTX `atom.add.f32`, now
  lower to `atomic_fetch_add_explicit` on `device atomic_float`; threadgroup float add/sub use a
  bit-pattern compare-and-swap helper because Metal has no threadgroup float atomics. Float min/max
  and CAS remain explicit diagnostics. Every Warp adjoint kernel depends on this.
- **`cuMemcpy3DAsync` silently copied nothing.** Its host-func callback re-entered `cuMemcpy3D` on
  the stream worker thread, which holds no current CUDA context, so the copy failed the context
  check and the error was discarded. Copy operands are now resolved when the copy is enqueued.

### Changed

- `unit_cumetalc_shared_ir` generates the `nvcc` shim it needs instead of assuming a build tree
  already has one. The shim is written on demand by `scripts/build_llama_cpp_cumetal.sh
  --toolkit-only`, never by the build, so the test passed in whichever tree had previously asked for
  one and failed in every other -- including a fresh Release configure. Same class as the PhysX
  harnesses that hardcoded `build/`.
- A `__device__` function passed by value as a callback is now recorded as a known compiler gap.
  It decays to a function pointer, so `cumetalc`'s native-AOT path rejects it with `indirect device
  calls are unsupported` unless something devirtualizes it first -- and `cumetalc` exposes no
  optimization level, so `--cuda-inline-threshold` maps to a `-fgpu-inline-threshold` that Clang
  discards. NVIDIA Warp's `bvh.cu` uses exactly this spelling for its `cub::BlockReduce` operator
  and builds only because it goes through the `nvcc` shim.
- The PhysX GRB conformance harnesses and their build scripts honour `CUMETAL_BUILD_DIR`, and ctest
  passes the tree that configured it. They hardcoded `build/`, so running the suite from any other
  build directory failed with `build is not a directory` rather than testing anything. They now also
  skip, rather than error, when CuMetal has not been built -- matching how every other prerequisite
  in those scripts is handled.
- The cuda-samples sweep-status check verifies the README headline only when the README states one.
  The README dropped its per-corpus figures when it was simplified, which left the check demanding a
  number the document no longer carried; the authoritative counts in
  `docs/known-gaps/verification.md` and `docs/verified-results.md` are still enforced
  unconditionally.

### Added

- **All 11 of NVIDIA Warp's `libwarp` CUDA sources now compile through CuMetal**, up from six. The
  CUB shim spelled its device-wide headers `.h` while CUB spells them `.cuh`, which is what callers
  include, so `cub/device/device_reduce.cuh` and `cub/device/device_run_length_encode.cuh`
  forwarders were added. `cub::DoubleBuffer` (`cub/util_type.h`) and the `DoubleBuffer` overloads of
  `DeviceRadixSort::Sort{Keys,Pairs}` were missing, as was `DeviceSegmentedRadixSort` entirely; both
  sort in place, so the selector handed back is the one passed in, which is correct for any caller
  that reads `Current()`. The radix sorts are now stable, as CUB's are -- Warp's sparse path
  run-length encodes sorted keys, so the order of equal keys decides which blocks pair up, and
  `std::sort` does not preserve it.
- **`cub::BlockReduce` works in device code.** Its methods were `__host__`, so a kernel calling
  `Reduce` got `call to __host__ function from __global__ function`, and its `TempStorage` was a
  `T` array, which a `__shared__` variable may not be once `T` has a user-provided default
  constructor -- `wp::vec3` in Warp's `bvh.cu` has one. It is now a cooperative tree reduction over
  threadgroup memory, with the sequential host fallback kept behind `__CUDA_ARCH__`, over
  uninitialized storage reached through `data()`. `functional_cuda_projects_cub_block_reduce` runs
  the partial-tile and full-tile forms on the GPU over a type with a non-trivial default
  constructor; `functional_cub_extended` covers `DoubleBuffer`, segmented sort and sort stability.
  The new fixture joins both exact corpora, so the in-tree numerical corpus is 28/28 and the
  production-metallib matrix 31/31.
- **`scripts/build_warp_cumetal.sh`**, which clones NVIDIA Warp at `v1.12.0`, applies the two
  upstream changes in `scripts/warp-patches/`, generates the CuMetal CUDA toolkit shim, and
  compiles each of `libwarp`'s 11 `.cu` files through it, reporting per file and failing if any of
  them regresses. The changes -- `crt.h` guarded on `WP_CUMETAL`, an
  `__APPLE__` driver `dlopen` branch, `--cuda-path` honoured on Darwin, a CuMetal branch in
  `build_dll.py`, and the `<new>` that `volume_builder.cu`'s placement `new` needs -- belong in
  NVIDIA's repository, so they are carried here as patches against a pinned clone rather than as a
  fork. Previously the only way to reproduce Warp results was a hand-patched local checkout.
- **`cuGetProcAddress`**, resolving against the library's own exported `cu*` symbols, plus
  `cuMemcpy2D`, `cuMemcpy2DAsync`, `cuMemcpyBatchAsync`, `cuEventRecordWithFlags` and
  `cuStreamGetCtx`. These are the driver entry points NVIDIA Warp resolves dynamically; with them
  every Warp entry point outside the OpenGL, IPC, graph-capture and CUDA-array groups is
  reachable. `functional_driver_proc_address` covers the lookup and each new entry point.
- NVIDIA Warp Phase 0 feasibility audit (`docs/warp-feasibility.md`).
- **`cudaTypedefs.h`**, generated from `cuda.h` by `scripts/generate_cuda_typedefs.py`, with the
  versioned `PFN_cu*` function-pointer typedefs hosts that load the driver dynamically declare.
  With it come the graph, stream-capture, IPC and graphics-interop types those signatures need
  (declared for compatibility; the entry points are not implemented), `CUDA_RESOURCE_VIEW_DESC`,
  the `CUfunction_attribute` spelling, and `cudaCpuDeviceId`.
- **`tex1D`**, and linear texture filtering for `float2`/`float4` fetches; the software filter
  previously only instantiated for scalar texel types.
- The `nvcc` shim accepts `-gencode=…` and the `-t`/`--threads` parallel-compilation flags.
- **The driver and runtime API surface NVIDIA Warp's `warp.cu` needs**: the
  `CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_PCI_*` identity triple, `MAX_SHARED_MEMORY_PER_BLOCK_OPTIN` and
  `MEMORY_POOLS_SUPPORTED` attributes; `CU_EVENT_RECORD_*` / `CU_EVENT_WAIT_*`,
  `CU_STREAM_ADD/SET_CAPTURE_DEPENDENCIES`, `CU_IPC_MEM_LAZY_ENABLE_PEER_ACCESS` and
  `CU_POINTER_ATTRIBUTE_MEMPOOL_HANDLE`; `cudaStreamAdd/SetCaptureDependencies`;
  `cudaMemPoolGetAccess` / `cudaMemPoolSetAccess`; `cudaGraphUpload`; `cudaGraphDebugDotPrint`,
  which writes a real Graphviz file; and graph user objects (`cudaUserObjectCreate`,
  `cudaUserObjectRetain`, `cudaUserObjectRelease`, `cudaGraphRetainUserObject`,
  `cudaGraphReleaseUserObject`), whose reference counting ties a host resource's destructor to a
  graph's lifetime. Apple Silicon has no PCI enumeration, so the identity triple reports zeros
  rather than failing; the pool-access calls describe the single device, which always has
  read-write access to its own pool. With these, `warp.cu` compiles against CuMetal; the CUB work
  above closed the rest.
- **An NVRTC and nvPTXCompiler surface** (`nvrtc.h`, `nvPTXCompiler.h`), exported from
  `libcumetal.dylib` and aliased as `libnvrtc.dylib`. `nvrtcCompileProgram` writes the program and
  any in-memory headers to a temporary directory and runs `cumetalc … --emit metallib`;
  `nvrtcGetCUBIN` returns those bytes, which `cuModuleLoadDataEx` already accepts by their `MTLB`
  magic, so a caller written against NVRTC never learns it is driving a Metal toolchain. NVRTC
  options that describe PTX/SASS code generation are recognised and dropped with a note in the
  program log; include paths, macros and the target architecture map onto `cumetalc` flags.
  `nvrtcGetPTX` fails and `compute_XX` architectures are rejected at compile time, because
  `cumetalc` lowers CUDA source to AIR and never to PTX; `nvPTXCompiler` passes PTX through, since
  the module loader compiles it. This is the surface NVIDIA Warp's `warp.cu` compiles its runtime
  kernels through.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **Float temporaries held in `.b32` registers were typed as unsigned integers, producing silently
  wrong results.** Optimized clang PTX keeps floating-point values in `.b32 %rN` registers, and the
  PTX->MSL emitter typed `neg`, `fma`, `mad`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `not`, `rcp`, `selp`, `mov`, and
  the unary math intrinsics from the *register spelling* rather than the instruction suffix. A
  kernel computing `c * (out[i] - a * p[i]) + b * q[i]` therefore emitted `uint vr11 = -a;`, which
  truncated every intermediate and clamped negatives to zero -- a wrong answer with no diagnostic.
  The instruction suffix is now authoritative at all of those sites, as it already was for the
  binary operators. This is the same flaw as the 0.1.x `cvt` rounding-mode bug, in the handlers
  that audit had flagged but not reached.

### Added

- **A tiny diffusion-model demo** (`demos/diffusion`). A 312,769-parameter DDPM is trained on MNIST
  in PyTorch, then sampled entirely by hand-written CUDA kernels through CuMetal: 1000 denoising
  steps, 16 images in ~13 s on an M4 Pro. `run.sh --check` gates a forward pass against PyTorch's
  own output at `max |cumetal - pytorch| < 2e-3` (measured 5.2e-06). The demo is what surfaced the
  `.b32` typing bug above.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Three runnable demos.** The Apollo demo is the front door; a 3D Gaussian Splatting demo runs
  industry CUDA on Apple GPUs; a 3D SPH dam break demo covers heavy simulation plus rendering.
- **`%lanemask_eq/le/lt/ge/gt` lower to real values,** derived from the simdgroup lane index.
- **Host `malloc`/`free`/`exit` are exposed via `cuda_runtime.h`.**
- **Layered CI groundwork and LLVM compatibility.**

### Fixed

- **`__activemask()` returned zero.** Clang lowers its inline asm to `mov.u32 %r, %activemask`
  rather than the standalone `activemask.b32` opcode, so it arrived as a special-register read and
  fell through to the generic path, which minted an uninitialised register slot. Any PTX special
  register CuMetal does not lower now refuses to lower instead of reading zero.
- **One `.callprototype` declaration made every entry in its module unlowerable,** including
  entries that never make an indirect call. The label is not followed directly by `:`, so the
  parser read it as an opcode.
- **Kernels lowered through the NVVM path shipped without a `.cumetal-abi` sidecar.**
  `cuLaunchKernel` then guessed the argument count by scanning `kernelParams` for a NULL
  terminator that CUDA does not guarantee, reading past the end of the caller's array. The sidecar
  is now derived from the imported IR's kernel ABI, and a launch that still has to fall back to the
  scan warns.
- **A double kernel launch on the source path under FP64 emulation.**
- **The PhysX GRB conformance build no longer configures against PhysX 5.6.1.** Four CMake
  variables were missing, including one that left the snippets directory never linking `PhysXGpu`.

### Changed

- **`cudaResourceType` is declared at namespace scope** with its four constants, matching the CUDA
  Toolkit, so stock sources compile without qualifying every use.
- **The legacy `__pipeline_*` helpers are callable from device code.** They are device primitives
  in CUDA; declaring them host-only made any device use a compile error. The copy stays
  synchronous, which trivially satisfies a later wait.
- **`assert` in `.cu` files no longer expands to nothing.** A `__device__` overload replaces the
  blanket macro no-op, so host-side assertions keep working and only device-side ones are dropped,
  which Metal cannot report anyway.
- **`cudaCreateTextureObject` warns once** when a linear or pitch2D resource is built while
  `CUMETAL_USE_METAL_DEVICE_ADDRESSES` is off. Device code dereferencing the resource pointer reads
  zeros with no error in that mode.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-30

### Removed

- **The installed `vectorAdd.cu` copy and its `cumetal doctor` suggestion have been removed.**
  Doctor now reports installation health only and ends at `No issues found!`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **`cumetalc` no longer prints spurious `+ptxNN` target-feature warnings.** PTX version features
  are now scoped to Clang's CUDA device compilation instead of leaking into the Apple arm64 host
  compilation.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-30

### Changed

- **`cumetal doctor` now has a Flutter-style, color-aware summary.** Required components use
  green checks, failures use red crosses, the optional binary shim is clearly informational,
  redirected output stays free of ANSI escapes, and `NO_COLOR` is respected.
- **The doctor example is now real.** `vectorAdd.cu` is installed under CuMetal's shared examples
  directory, and doctor prints a copy-paste compile command using its resolved absolute path.
  The installed-prefix gate compiles that exact installed file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-30

CuMetal compiles CUDA source to Metal and runs it on Apple Silicon GPUs, with a CUDA-compatible
runtime backed by Metal and Apple's acceleration frameworks. Read [What works](#what-works)
below before depending on it: CuMetal supports a documented subset of CUDA, not arbitrary CUDA
programs.

### Added

- **Homebrew tap packaging and an installed `cumetal` front door.** The
  `Lulzx/homebrew-tap` formula builds the source-first Release configuration with Homebrew LLVM
  and verifies it by compiling and running a CUDA kernel. `cumetal doctor` checks the complete
  local toolchain; `cumetal run` scopes runtime lookup to one child process without requiring
  global `DYLD_*` exports.
- **An installed-prefix end-to-end gate.** A fresh manifest-backed install must locate all of its
  headers, libraries, and Clang shims, pass `cumetal doctor`, compile the unmodified `vectorAdd`
  source, and execute it on the Apple GPU without caller environment setup.
- **`cumetalc foo.cu -o foo` builds a runnable executable.** An ordinary CUDA file — host code,
  `__global__` kernels, `<<<>>>` launches — compiles and runs with no host/device split and no
  `.metallib` path at runtime. Clang compiles the whole translation unit; device code travels as
  PTX inside a fatbinary and is lowered to a `.metallib` on first launch. Works from an install
  prefix as well as the build tree (`CUMETAL_ROOT` overrides discovery).
  `--link` / `--no-link` force the behavior; `--emit exe` is equivalent to `--link`.
- **`--save-temps`** keeps the intermediate object file from a link.
- **`cumetalc --version`**, plus `cumetalGetVersion()` / `cumetalGetVersionString()` in the
  runtime and `CUMETAL_VERSION*` macros in `cumetal_native.h`, so a version mismatch between
  headers and a loaded dylib is detectable.
- **`scripts/ci_report.sh`** reports passed/skipped/failed separately and names every skipped
  test, so a run cannot read as full coverage when part of the suite never executed.
- **`CUMETAL_ENABLE_CUDA_REGISTRATION`** build option (default `ON` in every build type),
  controlling the host CUDA registration ABI independently of the binary shim.
- **`samples/nativeLaunch`** documents the native `cumetalKernel_t` launch API, which
  `samples/vectorAdd` no longer needs to demonstrate.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**, **`docs/cla.md`**, and **`SECURITY.md`** — the clean-room contribution
  certification that `docs/legal-notice.md` referred to now exists, signed via `git commit -s`.
- **`ptx_sweep_numeric`** (spec §10.2): executes each PTX opcode on the GPU and compares
  bit-for-bit against a hand-derived ISA oracle, classifying SUPPORTED / WRONG / UNSUPPORTED.
  Covers integer and float arithmetic, shifts, bit ops, and every `cvt` rounding mode.
- **AIR ABI toolchain provenance** (spec §10.5): every AIR ABI test prints the macOS build, Xcode
  version, selected `TOOLCHAINS`, chip, and metal compiler version, so a result is attributable
  to the toolchain that produced it.

### Changed

- **The installer no longer edits shell startup files by default.** `--shell-config` is an
  explicit opt-in, and even that only adds the installation's `bin` directory to `PATH`. Installs
  now retain CMake's exact manifest so uninstall covers every tool, header, library, and shim.
- **Name-selected llm.c/GGML workload bodies are opt-in.** Generic PTX lowering still runs first;
  if it declines, the specialized table is consulted only with
  `CUMETAL_ENABLE_WORKLOAD_SPECIALIZATIONS=1`. The strict llm.c, llama.cpp, and GGML conformance
  launchers opt in explicitly; arbitrary CUDA projects cannot acquire a body from a colliding
  entry name.
- **The manifest-complete CUDA-project sweep uses a fresh JIT cache per fixture** and now enrolls
  the libdevice and ray-tracer strict projects. This prevents a prior compiler build from
  concealing a lowering regression and raises the clean local sweep from 9 to 11 projects.
- **`CUMETAL_ENABLE_BINARY_SHIM` now controls only the `libcuda.dylib` alias.** It previously
  also gated the host registration ABI (`__cudaRegister*`), which Clang emits when compiling
  *your own* `.cu` source. Because the flag defaults off in Release, the source-recompilation
  path was stubbed out and untested in the configuration users install.
- **The `cumetalc` backend default follows the input** rather than being one global setting.
  A direct `.cu` defaults to `--backend=cumetal-ir`; `--cuda-device` and PTX inputs default to
  `--backend=legacy`. Measured over the 19-file in-tree `.cu` corpus, direct `.cu` is legacy
  0/19 vs cumetal-ir 10/19, and `--cuda-device` is legacy 17/19 vs cumetal-ir 6/19 — the
  backends are complementary, not ranked. `--backend` overrides.
- `samples/vectorAdd` is a single self-contained `.cu` built with `cumetalc -o`.

### Fixed

- **`cumetalc` now quotes the complete temporary `PATH` assignment.** A normal desktop `PATH`
  containing a directory with spaces previously prevented Clang from starting, breaking the
  supposedly simple compile command before source compilation began.
- **The JIT cache key now identifies the compiler build that produced each entry.** It was
  (hand-maintained schema string + policy + PTX + kernel name), which describes nothing about how
  a given build lowers PTX — so changing an MSL template, an instruction handler, or a
  legalization rule produced the same key and the runtime silently reused a metallib compiled by
  the previous build. A cache populated across several builds held kernels from different
  compiler versions at once, and it crossed build trees. The key now includes the libcumetal
  Mach-O `LC_UUID`, which the linker regenerates whenever the binary changes.
- **Fixed a race in the specialized `fused_classifier_kernel3` MSL template.** Thread 0 read
  `row_logits[target]` to compute the loss while every thread overwrote `row_logits[]` with
  gradients immediately below, without a barrier. Together with the cache defect above this made
  the llm.c parity gate fail 2-4 runs in 15; measured 0/75 after both fixes.
- **Removed four name-matched body templates that silently miscompiled real kernels.**
  `lower_to_llvm.cpp` replaced a kernel's actual PTX body with a canned implementation whenever
  the entry name contained `vector_add`, `matrix_mul`, `neg`, or `reduce_sum` and the parameters
  had roughly the right shape — before generic lowering was attempted, and bypassing
  `--ptx-strict`. A kernel named `neg_but_actually_triples` computing `x*3` was emitted as
  `fneg`; `neg.s32` returned a float sign-bit flip. The unit and AIR ABI fixtures covering these
  paths had stub bodies but asserted computed ones, so they verified the templates rather than
  the compiler. Found by the new numerical PTX sweep on its first run.
- **The name-matched MSL specialization table no longer pre-empts real translation.**
  `lower_to_metal.cpp` consulted its hardcoded llm.c/GGML name table *before* attempting generic
  PTX→MSL translation, so a kernel whose name merely contained e.g. `gelu_forward_kernel` had its
  real body replaced by a canned one. Same defect as the LLVM-path templates; generic translation
  now wins wherever it succeeds, and the table only covers what it cannot lower. The table is
  additionally disabled unless the caller explicitly opts into workload compatibility.
- **`cumetal_bench` gates on the fastest iteration instead of the mean.** These kernels run in
  ~0.2 ms and are dispatch-jitter dominated (per-iteration spread reaches ~50% when lightly
  loaded), so the
  mean flaked the 2× ceiling under load and the median still reached 2.73× under CPU saturation.
  The fastest iteration estimates the uncontended cost and holds under 8-way saturation. This
  also retired a fictitious published figure — CuMetal was never 26% faster than hand-written
  Metal at `vector_add`; that was outliers inflating the native baseline.
- **Unlowerable kernels are refused rather than emitted empty.** Tolerant mode previously fell
  through to a bare `ret void`, producing a kernel that launched and wrote nothing while the
  caller read back stale buffer contents with no diagnostic.
- **PTX `cvt` rounding modes were ignored on both lowering paths**, silently producing wrong
  answers. In the MSL path the result was typed from the register *name*, so `cvt.rni.f32.f32`
  (clang's `rintf`) emitted an integer truncation — `rintf(2.7)` gave 2 and `rintf(-1.5)` gave 0.
  In the LLVM path the same instruction became an identity copy.
- **libdevice math was a hand-written `if` chain**, so any unlisted function aborted the whole
  kernel. Now table-driven; the surface went from 18/41 to 42/42, verified by executing each
  function against host libm rather than string-matching emitted IR.
- **PTX `.local` stack depots were hardcoded to 256 bytes**, ignoring the declared size. Frames
  larger than that were truncated and out-of-range slots read 0 instead of faulting, so
  `sgemm_2d` silently computed all zeros.
- **PTX→MSL pointer bases were resolved flow-insensitively**, so a register reused for a second
  pointer base retargeted every earlier use to the last base.
- **Four test harnesses reported on stale artifacts.** `run_samples_vector_add`,
  `run_cumetalc_cu_runtime_vector_add`, `run_runtime_vector_add`, and `run_runtime_axpy` each
  checked for a pre-existing binary or metallib *before* checking toolchain availability, so
  once any build produced one they stopped rebuilding and would have stayed green through a
  total compiler regression.
- **`run_standalone_cu.sh` no longer downgrades a wrong answer to a skip.** A kernel that runs
  and computes incorrect results is a failure; only genuinely unavailable lowering skips.
- **llama.cpp coherence.** Registered launches synchronize before returning by default.

### Security

- Approximate and passthru kernel lowerings are **refused by default** rather than silently
  returning wrong results. Opt in with `CUMETAL_ENABLE_APPROX_KERNELS=1`.
- One-time `CUMETAL WARNING` diagnostics for grid-wide cooperative launch (a no-op on Metal) and
  FP64 Dekker emulation (~44-bit mantissa).

### What works

Verified on Apple M4 Pro, macOS 26.6, Xcode 26.6:

- 213 tests pass in Debug with the binary shim on; 210 in Release with it off. No skips, no
  failures. A clean-rebuild Apple M4 Pro re-measurement on 2026-07-27 reports vector_add
  1.063×, saxpy 1.036×, and reduce_f32 1.008× against hand-written Metal, well inside
  the 2× ceiling.
- **llm.c** GPT-2 FP32 training reaches numerical parity with the PyTorch reference.
- **llama.cpp** greedy-decodes coherently on SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-Q4_K_M at ~279 tok/s with
  full offload. This is one model on a covered kernel subset, not general GGML support.
- **PhysX 5.6** reduced GRB runs selected sphere/plane, box/plane, box/box, convex/convex, and
  sphere/triangle-mesh contacts against CPU reference. Selected shape paths, not general PhysX.
- Library shims: cuBLAS, cuBLASLt, cuDNN, cuRAND, cuFFT, cuSPARSE, cuSOLVER, NVML, NCCL, thrust,
  CUB, NVTX.

### Known limitations

Dynamic parallelism, graphics interop, multi-GPU, and device-side texture sampling are
unsupported by design. Grid-wide cooperative sync is a no-op. FP64 runs emulated at ~44-bit
precision. Broad GGML kernel coverage, general PhysX shapes, and arbitrary CUDA C++ are not
claimed. See [docs/known-gaps.md](docs/known-gaps.md) for the full list — it is long, specific,
and worth reading before adopting.
